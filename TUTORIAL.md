# Basic Python Example

A test to try Python with CodeRoad

## 1. Add some numbers together

> Test out the basics

This is just a test, so here's the answer:

```py
def add(*args):
    '''Add 1 or more numbers together'''
    total = 0
    for arg in args:
        total += arg
    return total
```

### 1.1 Add

Complete the `add` function. It should be able to add one or more numbers together. 
For example: `add(1) = 1`, `add(1, 2) = 3`, and `add(1, 2, 3) = 6`.


## 2. Add DOCTYPE

> Add a DOCTYPE to an HTML file

HTML files should have a `DOCTYPE`. You can add one at the top of the `index.html` file like this: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

### 2.1

Add the DOCTYPE

#### HINTS

- Add `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the top of `index.html` and save the file
